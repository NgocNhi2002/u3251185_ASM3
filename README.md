**Rationale**
# Gordon Andrews Tribute Website

This project is a responsive and visually coherent website honoring renowned Australian designer **Gordon Andrews**. The primary goal was to present his legacy in an accessible and aesthetically pleasing format using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **media queries**.

##  Development Tools

- **Main Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
  - Used for the majority of the development effort
  - Helpful features: integrated terminal, live preview extensions, built-in HTML & CSS support

##  Responsive Design

Great attention was paid to ensure the website performs well across all screen sizes, including mobile devices like the iPhone 16:

- Implemented **media queries** and **flexible layouts** for adaptability
- Focused on layout structure to prevent elements from overlapping
- Iterative testing to refine breakpoints and structure

> **Challenge:** Early on, content boxes overlapped the footer and navigation on smaller screens.  
> **Solution:** Refined media queries and layout rules, although a mobile-first approach from the start could have prevented this.

##  Content & Aesthetics

- Strong emphasis on **accessibility** without sacrificing artistic design
- Biography section featured:
  - Text hierarchy with alignment, font sizing, and spacing
  - A **dark transparent background box** over an image to enhance readability while preserving ambiance

##  Design Process

- **Prototyping Tool:** Figma
  - Created wireframes and mockups
  - Key design features:
    - Fixed top navigation bar
    - Centered biography section with stylized text
    - Anchored footer
    - Semi-transparent portrait background of Gordon Andrews

- Final implementation closely matched the Figma wireframes in:
  - Navigation layout
  - Section positioning
  - Use of background imagery

##  Unimplemented Features

Some interactive features were planned but not fully realized due to time or technical limitations:

-  Image slider for showcasing Andrews’ work
-  Hover animations and section transitions
-  Attempted to style a background image with:
  - 60% opacity
  - `z-index` and `position` styling for layering  
  → **Outcome:** These features did not work as intended and were not included in the final version.

##  Highlights

- Good balance between **visual design** and **readability**
- Fully functional across various devices
- Clear visual reference from Figma helped ensure **consistency and structure**

---

> Overall, I am pleased with how the final website presents Gordon Andrews' legacy, particularly in balancing accessibility with artistic design.
