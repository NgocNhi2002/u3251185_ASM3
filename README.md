Rationale 
In this project, a website honoring renowned Australian designer Gordon Andrews was designed and developed. The goal was to create a responsive, visually coherent, and understandable website that showcases his legacy and makes good use of HTML, CSS, and media queries. Overall, I am pleased with the way the finished website presents its information both structurally and aesthetically, particularly in the way it strikes a balance between accessibility and design.
My main code editor for this project was Visual Studio Code, which I used for the majority of the development effort. Its integrated terminal, live preview extensions, and built-in support for HTML and CSS were particularly helpful to me.
I made sure the website was readable and functioning on all screen sizes, even mobile ones like the iPhone 16, by paying great attention to responsive design. Flexible layout modifications and well-structured media queries were used to accomplish this.
The structure and font of the biography section were another area that performed exceptionally well. I created a hierarchy with text alignment, font sizes, and spacing to make the content easier to scan. The site's artistic ambiance was preserved while readability was further enhanced by the use of a dark transparent backdrop box above the image.
However, there was room for improvement in a few areas. At first, I experienced problems with content boxes on smaller screens covering the footer and navigation bar. A bad user experience resulted from the layout intermittently breaking when viewed on small devices. I fixed this by iteratively testing and improving the media queries, but these issues might have been completely avoided if I had started with a mobile-first design strategy. 
Most of the pages on the finished website matched the first wireframes I made in Figma quite precisely. The navigation bar, the placement of the biography section, and the use of the backdrop image in particular all had good translations from design to code in terms of structure, layout, and visual hierarchy. My decisions during development were aided by having a clear visual reference from the start, which also guaranteed consistency across various screen sizes.
Additionally, while I had planned to incorporate an image slider and hover animations to add interactivity and image featuring Gordon Andrews by adjusting the image opacity to 60% and layering it behind the main content using appropriate z-index and position styling, the result added both personality and atmosphere to the design without overwhelming the text but at the end it can not work properly which meant these were not included in the final version.
Prototypes
I used Figma to produce wireframes and mockups early in the development process. A footer anchored at the bottom of the viewport, a centered biography section with stylized text, and a fixed top navigation bar were all features of these prototypes. From the beginning, a key visual component was the semi-transparent background featuring a portrait of Andrews.
Certain elements of the prototypes, such the background picture, navigation arrangement, and content organization, were fully incorporated into the finished design. Others, such as the intended interactive gallery for Andrews' work and the subtly animated section transitions, were either not included or only partially implemented because of time and technological constraints.
